#Git branch
Git branch can be explained as a timeline: if we want to change something in it,
we create a new timeline that branches off from the main one, but it doesn't affect the main timeline.
This way, we end up with two timelines that we can work on separately, and they don't influence each other.

#Git push
Git push is a command that allows you to send your branches or files to a remote repository, such as GitHub,
where these branches/files can then be viewed by other developers.

#Git pull
Git pull is a command that allows you to synchronize branches from a remote repository, such as GitHub,
with your local repository.
